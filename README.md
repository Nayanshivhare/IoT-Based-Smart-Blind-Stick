The friendly Operating System for IoT!






















God gifted sense of vision to the human being is an important aspect of our life. But there are some unfortunate people who lack the ability of visualizing things. The visually impaired have to face many challenges in their daily life. The problem gets worse when they travel to an unfamiliar location. Only few of the systems available for visually impaired people can provide through beep output. None of these systems work perfectly for both indoor and outdoor applications.

In this, we propose a device for the visually impaired which is focused on providing beep output for obstacle prevention. The proposed device is used for guiding individuals who are partially sighted or blind. This device is used to help blind people to travel with the same ease and confidence as sighted people. The device has proximity sensor. The whole device is designed to be small and is used in conjunction with the stick. This device is being very helpful for those visually impaired people , which are supposed to face many day to day problems based on there regularity towards there life. 

The problem gets worse when there is an obstacle in front of them. Blind stick is an innovative stick designed for visually disabled people for improved survival. The paper presents a theoretical system concept to provide a smart ultrasonic aid for blind people. The system is intended to provide overall measures â€“ Artificial vision and detection. The aim of the overall system is to provide a low cost and efficient aid for a visually impaired person who gets a sense of artificial vision by providing information about the environmental scenario of static and dynamic objects around them.
